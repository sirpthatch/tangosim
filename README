TODO:
* (x) Tests - for simple tango game
* (x) Rotational coordinate systems
* (x) Simulation results
* (x) Pop tile scoring and incorporate into greedy strategy
* (x) Tests for popping dynamics - scoring and multipop in particular
* (x) Move dynamics
* (x) Way to render the outcome of a game
* Fix constraint around not allowing moves that segment the board

Nice to Have:
* Way to render a gamboard state and select the next move
* Way to allow for interactive two player game
* Way to allow for computer versus player configurability in game
* Way to allow for online game
* Defensive strategy
* Weighted tile value strategy
* (x) Detecting an enclosed position
* Game Diagnostics (avg number of turns, options evaluated per play, advantage of going first)
