The advanced version of the game introduces a new game semantic - the ability of a player to move
one of their own tiles.

During a player's turn, they can move a tile to a valid position that is up to N spaces away, where
N = the total number of blank spaces on the tile.  So if a tile has three filed in edges and three unfilled edges, it is eligible to move up to three spaces away from its current location (it can move one or two as well).  Tiles can rotate as they move.

A moved tile can land in an enclosed area, so long as it is not surrounded or it causes a different tile to pop out.

The game ends when one player has the no more tiles and they currently have the most points.
